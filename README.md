👋 Hi, I’m @Laummendoza

 I’m interested in hacking my life! How? making my own path, taking decisions, some risks if it´s necessary and being consistent, responsible and determined.

🌱 I’m currently learning  backend development with Java. I try to expand my kknowledge every day.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on changing lifes because I´m passionate about teamwork. We are like a large network in which the growth of some can help the growth of others.

📫 you can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laumendoza)

I´m going to update my backend projects in a few days.  Thank you for READ-ing ME!!
